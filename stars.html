						<h2>Greetings Young Padawan</h2>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="scroller" id="opening" style="align-content: center;">
								<p>
									The universe has brought you here to NTU by no accident. 
									An exciting journey lies ahead of you. <br>
								</p>
								<p>
									At the beginning of every semester, a war of intense magnitude wages across the island of Pulau NTU.
									A war of survival, every man for himself. Some leave the war victorious while others are left fighting over scraps.
								</p>
								<p><strong>This is STAR Wars. </strong></p> 
								<p>
									Looking win the war? Seek and ye shall find.
									Coined by NTU students, STAR Wars is a course registration process in NTU where you battle with your peers to get the courses you want for a good timetable. 
								</p>
								<p>Let us begin.</p>

									<p>
										NTU uses a <i>first come first serve</i> system for course registration. So, FASTEST FINGERS FIRST! <br>
										Before you charge to register your courses, here's an overview of what to expect.
										<br>
										As a freshman you won't experience STAR Wars in your first semester, but there's still ADD/DROP. During which, you are able to make changes to your given timetable.
									</p>

										<p>
											If you have <u>just matriculated</u>, courses have already been registered for you. So fret not, enjoy it while you still can. You'll be directed to print out your timetable after you have matriculated. Then, just wait for Add/ Drop.

								<p>Allocations for UE and GERPE are not on first come first serve basis (hence the waitlist). On the first night of Add/Drop, the system will allocate UE/GERPE prioritising senior year students first. Subsequently, at 10pm every night till end of Add/Drop, the system allocates courses to students randomly. If you're allocated courses on the last day, you can drop any of your courses on the
								next day </p>

								<p>During this 2-week Add/ Drop period, you can assess whether you like the courses you have registered or not. If you don't, you can drop it and try another without any penalty. You can also swap timeslots for a better timetable or reclassify your UE/GERPE.</p>

								<p>If you're unsuccessful in getting the UE/GERPE, you can submit a course appeal form (no guarantees you'll get it though!) and pray that the system works in your favour. You'll be informed before the end of Add/Drop</p>

								<p>Once the period is over, you'll receive a confirmation email on all the courses you'll take in the coming semester. Check your final timetable here.You can no longer submit anymore appeals/requests</p>

								<p>If you're taking level 1 language modules for UE (go try it's fun!),  you need to declare if you have previously studied the subject.</p>

								<p>If you're taking modules that need auditions (mainly NIE courses). They are usually conducted during the first lesson. NIE will submit the names for the selected students to OAS for registration. You'll be notified once registration is completed</p>
					
								<p>Thinking of taking a minor? You can inform the school your intention and appeal for any prerequisite waiver. Email the UPO with the approved waiver. Your UEs will be used to fulfil the requirements of your chosen minor. </p>
								

								<p>For smarties who are offered to pursue a second major and accelerated program, you can register during your STAR Wars period or otherwise during Add/drop.</p>
